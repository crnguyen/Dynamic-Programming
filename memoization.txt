Solving Dynamic Programming problems using Memoization

1. make it work
- visualize the problem as a tree
- implement that tree using recursion
- test it

2. make it efficient
- add a memo object 
(memo object needs to have keys and values)
    keys = arguments to our function
    values = return values for function calls
- add a base case to return memo values that captures the memos (basically looking up some stored value within the memo)
- store return values into the memo
